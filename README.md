Void is my name for a board game I designed in college. 

# Rules of Void
Void is an abstract strategy board game for two players.

### Components and Terminology
Void is played on a circular board. The central area of the board (the void) is encircled by five concentric rings (orbits) each divided into eighteen segments (sectors). It requires two sets (fleets), black and white, of eight pieces (ships): one flagship, two bombers, two sweepers, and three fighters.

The innermost (first) orbit is the "lowest" while the outermost (fifth) orbit is the "highest". So, in Void, "above" means "further out" and "below" means "further in".
